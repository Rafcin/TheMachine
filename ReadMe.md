Script.js - Used to create and render the scene using Three.js
Three.js - Library used to render 3d or 2d things
Camera Control.js - Lets you move around the scene

The idea of this small project is to create a Plexus like view from person of interest where you have each sphere as a data point visualization and each line is another set of data and you have a whole tree that you can move around and look at in 3d space.
